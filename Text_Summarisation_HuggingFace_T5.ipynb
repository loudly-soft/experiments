            "shortly after the moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago, it may have begun generating a magnetic field, a protective sheath that can deflect away charged particles from the sun. Researchers report August 4 in Science Advances. Magnetized lunar rocks brought back by Apollo astronauts decades ago were the first indication that the moon may have once had an internal dynamo, in which molten, iron-rich rock swirls inside the core of a celestial body, giving rise to a magnetic field. How long such a lunar dynamo may have endured has been unclear. --- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/message Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support --- Send in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/message Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/scienceadventures/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support/support\n",

If these outbreaks aren’t likely to be particularly dangerous for school-age children, but could be problematic for traditionally more vulnerable younger siblings or elderly relatives. Because the symptoms of these illnesses often mirror those of COVID-19, it could make having kids back in the classroom and keeping them there much more challenging.

These new guidelines come after nearly a week of intense debate and last minute seesawing over who should be eligible for an extra dose. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on September 22 granted an emergency use authorization that opened the door for booster shots for those who might be exposed to the coronavirus on the job. On September 23, an advisory panel rejected booster shots for those who might be exposed to the coronavirus on the job. Still, there is no evidence of waning protection against SARS-CoV-2. --- This episode is sponsored by  Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. https://anchor.fm/app Support this podcast: https://anchor.fm/vaccinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecinecine\n",
